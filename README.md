# IMPRS Course: Introduction to Neural Networks (2023)

## Introduction
In this workshop, we will cover the **absolute basics** that underlie any neural network so that you can understand how this technology works, what to expect from a deep learning model, and where to be careful.  We will learn the basics with simple models using **TensorFlow** and visualize everything to understand exactly what the models are doing. 

We will train a model on a regression problem to predict protein concentration, followed by a classification problem to separate types of microbial cells in a 2D image. Finally, we will work with an image classification model that can predict whether a cell is infected with the malaria parasite.<br>
<br>
Who is this course for?
- Beginners who have no experience with neural networks and are interested in understanding the basic concepts of this technology.<br>
<br>

What to expect:
- Learn the basics of neural networks and what you can expect from these models.
- Learn why neural networks are not 100% accurate and what that means for you in practice 
- Learn what intelligence means in the context of neural networks
<br>

The course is held in person at the MPI in Marburg, but the notebooks are **self-explanatory**, so they are useful for everyone.
